INTRODUCTION
------------
Do you want to accept payments from mobile users in different countries, different payment system by writing just few of code lines? 
Paymentwall SDK is a global mobile payment gateway that accepts payments from more than 200 countries with 100+ alternative payment options. We now provide SDK for iOS which will become a native part of your application, it eliminates the necessity to open a web browser for payments. Less steps, faster process, there’s no doubt your conversion rate will get boost! All you have to do is import the library into your project and config it to start accepting in-app payment. It is quick and easy! We'll guide you through the process here.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
-----------------
1. Add the framework to your project. 
With different areas, we provide corresponding external payment system framework files. You can add as many as you want. You can also enable/disable default payment options too. You can add any payment option as they want by importing the payment system framework and framework plugin provided by Paymentwall to your project
2. User requests a purchase inside your application.
3. Paymentwall SDK initializes payment screen with 3 core payment options (Brick, MINT, Mobiamo) and the other is “Local Payments” option.
4. User initiates payment in-app 
With Brick, Mint, Mobiamo the payment process will totally be native.
With local payments, local payment screen will be shown with payment methods corresponding to user’s current location. Here users can then select a payment option they prefer.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
XCode 8.0+, iOS 8.0+

CREDENTIALS
-----------
SDK integration requires a project key. Obtain these Paymentwall API credentials in the application settings of your Merchant Account at [Paymentwall.com](http://paymentwall.com/)

ADDING SDK (Paymentwall Core SDK)
---------------------
Our SDK is delivered as static library or public repository.

### Install with Cocoapods:

1. Install CocoaPods 0.39.0 or later
2. In your Podfile, add `pod 'PWCoreSDK'` and `pod 'PW[Local payment method]Plugin'`(optional) to your main and test targets
3. From the command line, run `pod install`
4. Use the .xcworkspace file generated by CocoaPods
5. Add `-ObjC` to `Other Linker Flags` in your project's Build settings
6. If you are using Swift, create a new Objective-C file in order to create new `bridging-header.h` files, then import the following files into the header file like:
```objective-c
#import <PWCoreSDK/PWCoreSDK.h> 
```

### Install as Static library:

1. Download the latest release of the SDK and extract the zip.
2. Go to your Xcode project’s “General” settings. Drag libPWCoreSDK.a and other plugin library to your project directory to the “Linked frameworks and libraries” section. Make sure Copy items if needed is selected and click Finish.
3. In your unit test target’s “Build Settings”, add the parent path to libPWCoreSDK.a in the “Library Search Paths” section.
4. Drag the bundle into your "Copy bundle resources" in project's "Build phase"
5. Add `-ObjC` to `Other Linker Flags` in your project's Build settings
6. If you are using Swift, create a new Objective-C file in order to create new `bridging-header.h` files, then import the following files into the header file like:
```objective-c
#import <PWCoreSDK/PWCoreSDK.h> 
```

Create your first payment
-------------------------
1. Setup the SDK with the following params:
```swift
PWCoreSDK.sharedInstance().setupPaymentwall(withProjectKey: "YOUR PUBLIC KEY", secretKey: "YOUR SECRET KEY", signVersion: 3, requestTimeout: 30)
```
>Optional:  Default UI of the SDK is game style, to use flat UI, add this to your code: `PWCoreSDK.sharedInstance().setUseFlatUI(true)`

>Project key: All payment option will use this Project key if their Project key set to nil, you also can specify their own Project key

>Secret key: PWLocal and local payment options plugins will use this Secret key as default if you specify it here

2. Create new payment with `PaymentObject` class:
```swift
let payment = PaymentObject()
payment.name = choosenItem.name
payment.price = Double(choosenItem.price)!
payment.currency = "USD"
payment.image = choosenItem.image
payment.userID = "test_user"
payment.itemID = choosenItem.name+"id"
payment.pwLocalParams = customSetting

PWCoreSDK.sharedInstance().setPaymentObject(payment)
```

>Note: For pwLocalParams, please refer [PWLocal docs](https://www.paymentwall.com/en/documentation/PWLocal-iOS-SDK/3358) or demo to see more ways to create params

3. Implement `PWCoreSDKDelegate` protocol to handle payment response:
```swift
func paymentResponse(_ response: PWCoreSDKResponse?) {
    guard let response = response else { return }
    switch response.responseCode {
        case .SUCCESSFUL:
        case .FAILED:
        case .CANCEL:
    }

    switch response.paymentType {
        case .NONE:
        case .MINT:
        case .PWLOCAL:
        case .BRICK:
        case .MOBIAMO:
        case .OTHERS:
    }
}
```

4. Add Brick payment type, please refer below on how to handle Brick payment flow, cardScannerPlugin is distributed as a plugin and is optional:

```swift
PWCoreSDK.sharedInstance().addBrickPayment(withPublicKey: nil, useNativeFinishDialog: true, cardScannerPlugin: PWCardScannerPlugin.sharedInstance())
```

5. Add Mobiamo payment type, `noPrice` specify if you want to use the default Mobiamo price for each country:

```swift
PWCoreSDK.sharedInstance().addMobiamoPayment(withAppID: nil, noPrice: true)
```

6. Add Mint payment type:
```swift
PWCoreSDK.sharedInstance().addMintPayment(withAppID: nil)
```
7. Add PWLocal payment type:
```swift
PWCoreSDK.sharedInstance().addPWLocalPayment(with: .DIGITAL_GOODS_FLEXIBLE, secretKey: nil)
```

8. Add any other local payment option plugin if you want, please refer Implement local payment options section below on how to create them:

```swift
PWCoreSDK.sharedInstance().addCustomPaymentOptions([alipay, unionpay, ...])
```

9. Present Payment options view controller:

```swift
PWCoreSDK.showPaymentOptionsViewController(withParentViewcontroller: self, delegate: self, showCompletion: nil)
```

Brick payment flow
-------------------
1. After the token is successfully fetched, the `response: PWCoreSDKResponse` will contain the `token: BrickToken` along with it
2. Send request to your server to handle the token, if `useNativeFinishDialog` is set to `false`, you can show your own success or failed dialog after it finish, otherwise post a `Notification` to use the SDK success or failed dialog and close itself, THIS IS ONLY FOR HANDLE AFTER YOU PROCESS THE TOKEN, other error during fetching token will be handle automatically without posting notification:

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: Notification.Name(BRICK_TOKEN_PROCESSED_FINISH), object: nil, userInfo: nil)
```
> Note: Pass the error as Dictionary with key = "error" and value is the error message, the SDK will automatically show failed dialog instead of successful dialog

Implement local payment option
------------------------------
Panda++ supports external payment system injection (which are in our defined payment system (PS) list). Each time you want to add a new payment system, you have to include it's native SDK into your project along with our plugin framework, our framework will handle creating all the necessary parameters then you can use them to show the native local payment SDK:

1. Add the plugin with Cocoapods with `pod 'PW[Local payment method]Plugin'` or manually dragging the `PW[Local payment method]Plugin.a` and it's headers file to your project
2. Import pod modules (if use `use_frameworks!`) or library header into your project
3. Setup the plugin, each plugin have different requirements so please check their header files and local payment option docs on their websites for more information:
```swift
let alipay = PWAlipayPlugin()
alipay.appId = "external"
alipay.appScheme = "YOUR APP SCHEME"

//For international alipay payment
alipay.itbPay = "30m"
alipay.forexBiz = "FP"
alipay.appenv = "system=ios^version=\(UIDevice.current.systemVersion)"
```
>Note: All plugins support your own signature string if you don't specify Secret key in both CoreSDK and PluginSDK, use `plugin.getStringToSign()` to get the string to sign, then add your signed string to `plugin.signString`
